# Exploring Salary Trends in Data Science Careers

This project dives into data science job market trends with a specific focus on salary distribution. Using extensive visualizations and data analysis techniques, the project provides insights into how factors like
employment type, work model, experience level, and company size impact salaries in data science careers.

## Project Overview
The primary objectives of this analysis are to:
Uncover how employment types (full-time, part-time, contract) influence salaries.
Compare salary trends across remote, hybrid, and in-person roles.
Analyze salary distributions by experience level and company size.
Identify and handle salary outliers to enhance data accuracy.

## Key Features
### Data Analysis
Employment Type Analysis: Examined salaries across different employment types to identify any significant differences.
Experience Level Insights: Grouped and analyzed data by experience levels (entry, mid, senior, executive) to understand salary progression in data science roles.

## Visualizations
This project includes a series of in-depth visualizations to uncover patterns and trends in data science salaries. Key visualizations examine salary distributions across work models, employment types, and company
sizes, offering insights into how different job characteristics impact compensation. Additional charts display the frequency of job postings across categories, enabling a comprehensive view of the data science job
market landscape.
